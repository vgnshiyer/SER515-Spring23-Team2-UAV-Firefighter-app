### Adapter Pattern
Adapter pattern is a design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a wrapper (adapter) that translates one interface to another. It is used to convert the interface of a class into another interface that the client expects. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to reuse existing code without modifying it or when you have to work with a legacy system that has an incompatible interface.

### Before you begin

Please follow below steps to execute the program:

Execute this command in the directory 'ObserverPattern/src'
