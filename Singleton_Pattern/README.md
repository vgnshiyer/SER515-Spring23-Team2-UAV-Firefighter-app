### Observer Pattern
This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to that instance. 
In the context of this application, we are considering a pack of drones to be a singleton. Therefore for every drone, there must be only one instance of the pack which must be globally accessible. The class Pack will have a static variable which will hold the instance of the class and can only be accessible from one of the methods in the class..

### Before you begin

Please follow below steps to execute the program:

Execute this command in the directory 'Singleton_Pattern/src'
